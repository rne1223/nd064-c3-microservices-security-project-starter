Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.
    - **Tampering** dockerfiles could happen if a **docker client** is compromise by a hacker. Which means that changes could be made to a dockerfile 
    without the authors knowledge. 
    - Communications between the **docker client** and **deamon** could be **spoof** if the hacker gets control of either system.
    - A **docker deamon's configuration** could be tampered by a hacked **docker client**.
    - A **docker deamon's priviledge** could be escalated if it defaults to using root, which could give access to the hacker to other containers in the system
    - If hacker could access the **docker regestry**, infected images could be uploaded without the author's and users knowledge. The hacker could **repudiate** his
    actions because he would have access to the regestry. 


Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. 
At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).
