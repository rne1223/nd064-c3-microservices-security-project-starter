Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.
    - **Tampering** dockerfiles could happen if a **docker client** is compromise by a hacker. Which means that changes could be made to a dockerfile 
    without the authors knowledge. 
    - Communications between the **docker client** and **deamon** could be **spoof** if the hacker gets control of either system.
    - A **docker deamon's configuration** could be tampered by a hacked **docker client**.
    - A **docker deamon's priviledge** could be escalated if it defaults to using root, which could give access to the hacker to other containers in the system


Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.
    - If a hacker gets access to **Kubernetes's control plane**, all calls to the api server could be **spoof**.
    - A hacker could **disclose** sensitve information from the **etcd**.
    - An **elevation of privilege** can happen if the **kube-apiserver** is hacked.
    - A **worker node** could be **tampered** if the kube configuration does not have the right user permissions.
    - A **worker node** could also overwelm the system with a **denial of service** attack by a hacker. 

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. 
At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).
