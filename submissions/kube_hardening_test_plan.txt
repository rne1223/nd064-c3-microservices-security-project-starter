Kubernetes is a large system with many moving parts. One could easily disrupt the production setup with a simple change. 
Therefore, there needs to be a goal to achieve and a plan to execute for disruptions to be minimal. Letâ€™s say that my goal 
is to harden the kube-apiserver with no disruptions to production and being able to handle the same traffic load as before. 
For this goal to take place, I would create a non-production environment to test and harden the cluster. This non-production 
environment could handle the same traffic loads as production, but only synthesized traffic can be used while changes are being applied. 
I would choose Prometheus and Grafana to monitor and display the metrics of the non-production environment while the changes are taking place. 
This way I could see if the new configurations are relevant and making a positive impact on the cluster. Once enough positive changes have been 
made and the goal is achieved, then it is time to test some non-synthesized traffic on the non-production cluster. It is better to test a 
small sample on the new environment than make the switch and find out that nothing works when there is real traffic. If everything goes according 
to plan with the small sample and the goal is achieved then the non-production environment becomes the production environment. Otherwise I go 
back to the drawing board to make the changes that are needed to achieve the goal. Rinse and repeat until the goal is met or the goal is changed.
